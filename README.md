# Flight-Data-Analysis-using-Python-and-R

The 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo consisted of flight arrival
and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA from October 1987 to April 2008. 

The complete dataset, along with supplementary information and variable
descriptions, can be downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse at
https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7

The “2006” and “2007” year datasets obtained from the Harvard Website(https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7) were used for this project. Data was cleaned apprpriately before conducting the analysis in depth. Data was visualised using both Python andR languages to answer the following research questions;

(a) What are the best times and days of the week to minimise delays each year?

(b) Evaluate whether older planes suffer more delays on a year-to-year basis.

(c) For each year, fit a logistic regression model for the probability of diverted US flights
using as many features as possible from attributes of the departure date, the scheduled departure and arrival times, the coordinates and distance between departure
and planned arrival airports, and the carrier. Visualize the coefficients across years.
